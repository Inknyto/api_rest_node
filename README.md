# api_rest_node
This is the repository for my REST api. it uses Node js, and Express js. It can also be started with PM2. Enjoy!

The entry point is index.js. The api's server can be run with the command "node index.js".  
It can be ran as background process with "node index.js &". 

It can be daemonized with pm2 process manager with "node index.js &".
